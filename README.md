# AnkiIDE

AnkiIDE adds syntax highlighting to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)'s template editor for easier template creation and editing under the `Add` | `Cards...` window in Anki using the [Esprima](https://github.com/jquery/esprima) library. AnkiIDE is based on [anki-template-editor](https://github.com/ericahn/anki-template-editor) with significant changes both to functionality and user accessibility.
